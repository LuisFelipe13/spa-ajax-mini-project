# API Mini Project
Today, we'll be building a mini Single Page Application (SPA, every interaction is handled asynchronously, the browser is never refreshed) to explore the power of asynchronous request (Ajax) and how they can benefit the user experience.

## Project Guidelines
Find an API of interest which does not require oAuth authentication and supports [Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository [Boilerplate folder](http://github.com)
2. Add your Javascript code to the lib folder and try to structure your code following Object Oriented and Component patterns.

## Project Requirements
Build an application which allows you to:
1. Search an API
2. From the search results select a resource to view it's details
3. Bonus: It's 2017. It's a fetcher year! Let's make toneloke proud and let use .fetch() and promises to write proper JS code.
4. Bonus #2: Ability to 'save' (temporary for the duration of the browser session) a resource to a list which gets added at the bottom of the page (i.e. car lab and for further i.e(s). speak to Jason or Lindsey).

## Sample Project
Build an SPA that allows you to search the Google Books api, view a book details and save the book to a reading list.
